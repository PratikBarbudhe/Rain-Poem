            <p>
                Rain, rain, come come again,<br>
                Washing away the dust and pain.<br>
                From the heavens, you gently fall,<br>
                Refreshing the earth, one and all.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Pitter-patter, your rhythm plays,<br>
                Serenading nature in myriad ways.<br>
                Leaves glisten as you softly touch,<br>
                A symphony of droplets, we love so much.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Rain, rain, nourish the land,<br>
                Sowing seeds with a tender hand.<br>
                The flowers bloom, their colors bright,<br>
                Under your touch, the world feels right.<br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Let your gentle showers cleanse the air,<br>
                And wash away every worry and care.<br>
                Rain, rain, a gift from above,<br>
                We welcome you with hearts full of love.<br>
            </p>
